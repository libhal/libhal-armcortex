/**
 * @brief Set the address of the systems interrupt vector table
 *
 * The interrupt vector table (IVT) is held in ROM which means that, either
 * the interrupt service routines (ISR) had to be defined at compile time
 * making them immutable at runtime, or that each ISR calls a mutable function
 * pointer which can be changed at runtime.
 *
 * The problem with the first option is that it makes writing and using
 * libraries difficult. Usually requiring updates to the IVT manually by the
 * application designer based on what libraries and drivers the application is
 * using.
 *
 * The second solution has a problem where the additional another layer of
 * indirection increases interrupt latency. A more critical problem of this
 * approach is that many ISRs take advantage of the state of the system when
 * the ISR runs. For example, context switching in an RTOS needs to be able to
 * see the address of where code was when the interrupt occurred and having an
 * additional point of indirection (i.e. calling a function pointer) will
 * change that location from the task to the ISR that called the context
 * switch function. This will usually result in a fault of some sort.
 *
 * Creating an interrupt vector table in RAM and relocating the ISRs there
 * consumes RAM space, but gives great flexibility over the table at runtime.
 *
 * @param p_table_location - address of the interrupt vector table.
